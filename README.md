# Blue_Assistant
I made an voice assistant , that can help you with some basic stuffs
[ 1.OPEN/CLOSE APPS
 2. DO ANY WEB SEARCH AND RETRIVE THE BEST QUERY
 3. PLAY ANY VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
4. GET YOU WEATHER UPDATES BY CITY NAMES
5. DO ANY MATHS INCLUDES BASIC TRIGONOMETRY AND LOGS AS WELL(JUST BASIC CALCULATOR STUFFS)
 6. ALSO HAS VOLUME CONTROLS ]


The app was made with python and was purely made for learning and experimenting , source code is in this repo !
to download and use the assistant use the google drive link below and as i am not a microsoft devloper so your microsoft defender might flag this as a virus :) this is not a virus so you may have to manually exclude this app in the virus and threat protection. Thank You
